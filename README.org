* Linux Notification Center

A haskell-written notification center for BSPWM and polybar users.

** Features

The notification center receives notifications via DBUS (like any
notification daemon) and shows them in the upper right corner of the
screen. The notification (if not specified in the notification
otherwise) will also be shown in the notification center even after
the notification disappeared by itself. The notifications can be
clicked to make them disappear.

Notifications can be replaced by the use of the =replaces-id= feature
of the notification specification.

The notification center can (optionally) show user-specified buttons
in the bottom that can be in two states (highlighted/not highlighted)
and that can run customable shell commands.

** Usage

To start it:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
> linux-notification-center
#+END_SRC


Toggle between hidden and shown state of the notification center:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
kill -s USR1 $(pidof linux-notification-center)
#+END_SRC


Set the state of a user defined button (in this example the first
button, which has =id= 0):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# turn highlighting on
notify-send.py a --hint boolean:linux-notification-center:true int:id:0 boolean:state:true

# turn highlighting off
notify-send.py a --hint boolean:linux-notification-center:true int:id:0 boolean:state:true
#+END_SRC
This snippet uses [[https://github.com/phuhl/notify-send.py][notify-send.py]], a improved version of libnotify
(notify-send).

** Install

Requires [[https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/stack/][stack]] on Arch and [[https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=haskell-stack&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all][haskell-stack]] on Ubuntu. Alternatively
stack can be installed by curl-ing and installing it directly like
this:  =curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh=. More
information on stack [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/][here]].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

*** Stack commands

If you want to run stack yourself instead of using make:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stack setup
stack build
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

No configuration is necessary, the notification center comes with
sensible defaultsâ„¢.

Nearly all colors and many sizes are customizable, as well well as the
default timeout for notifications and the optional buttons in the
notification center. Below are possible configurable options shown.
The configuration file must be located at
=~/.config/deadd/deadd.conf=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[notification-center]
marginTop = 0
width = 500

[notification-center-notification-popup]
notiDefaultTimeout = 10000
distanceTop = 50
distanceRight = 50
distanceBetween = 20
width = 300

[colors]
background = rgba(29, 27, 20, 0.6)
notiBackground = rgba(9, 0, 0, 0.5)
notiColor = #fef3f6
critical = rgba(255, 0, 50, 0.5)
criticalColor = #FFF
criticalInCenter = rgba(155, 0, 20, 0.5)
criticalInCenterColor = #FFF
buttonColor = #eae2e0
buttonHover = rgba(0, 20, 20, 0.2)
buttonHoverColor = #fee
buttonBackground = transparent
labelColor = #eae2e0

[buttons]
buttonsPerRow = 5
buttonHeight = 60
buttonMargin = 2
labels = "VPN":"Bluetooth":"Wifi":"Screensaver"
commands = "sudo vpnToggle":"bluetoothToggle":"wifiToggle":"screensaverToggle"
buttonColor = #fee
buttonBackground = rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)
buttonHover = rgba(0, 20, 20, 0.2)
buttonHoverColor = #fee
buttonTextSize = 12px;

buttonState1 = rgba(255,255,255,0.5)
buttonState1Color = #fff
buttonState1Hover = rgba(0, 20, 20, 0.4)
buttonState1HoverColor = #fee
buttonState2 = rgba(255,255,255,0.3)
buttonState2Color = #fff
buttonState2Hover = rgba(0, 20, 20, 0.3)
buttonState2HoverColor = #fee
